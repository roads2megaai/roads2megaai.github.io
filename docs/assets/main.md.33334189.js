However, this route to success in deep learning is unsustainable. Training a large transformer model in natural language processing, for instance, can incur a higher carbon footprint than the total lifetime cost of five cars. In addition, these state-of-the-art models require immense memory and computing resources during deployment, which hinders their practical impact. To realize the full promise and benefits of artificial intelligence, we must solve these scalability challenges prevalent in both training and inference and design new algorithms with step-function improvements in efficiency. This workshop aims to bring together both computer science researchers and practitioners focused on ML efficiency to offer innovative solutions towards efficient modeling workflows grounded in principled algorithm design.</p><h2 id="confirmed-speakers" tabindex="-1">Confirmed Speakers <a class="header-anchor" href="#confirmed-speakers" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Confirmed Speakers&quot;">​</a></h2><ul><li>Jonathan Frankle (Harvard, USA)</li><li>Micheal Mitzenmacher (Harvard, USA)</li><li>Chen Luo (Amazon)</li><li>Furong Huang (University of Maryland)</li></ul><h2 id="draft-schedule" tabindex="-1">Draft Schedule <a class="header-anchor" href="#draft-schedule" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Draft Schedule&quot;">​</a></h2><ul><li>8:30am-8:40am - Welcome and Opening Remarks (Workshop Organizers)</li><li>8:40am-9:40am - Keynote #1: Prof. Michael Mitzenmacher (Harvard)</li><li>9:40-10:05am - Invited Talk</li><li>10:05am - 10:30 am - Invited Talk</li><li>10:30-10:40 - Break</li><li>10:40am-11:40am - Keynote #2: Dr. Bilge Acun (Meta)</li><li>11:40-12:05pm - Invited Talk</li><li>12:05pm-12:30pm - Invited Talk</li><li>12:30pm-1:30pm - Lunch Break</li><li>1:30pm - 2:30pm - Keynote #3: Prof. Jonathan Frankle (Harvard)</li><li>2:30pm-3pm - Keynote #4: Prof. Furong Huang (UMD)</li><li>3:00pm-3:40pm - Keynote #5: Dr. Chen Luo (Amazon)</li><li>3:40-3:50pm - Break</li><li>3:50pm-4:30pm - Panel Discussion (Mitzenmacher, Frankle, Acun, Luo, Shrivastava)</li><li>4:30pm - Social</li></ul><h2 id="organizing-committee" tabindex="-1">Organizing Committee <a class="header-anchor" href="#organizing-committee" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Organizing Committee&quot;">​</a></h2><ul><li>Zhaozhuo Xu (Rice University, USA)</li><li>Aditya Desai (Rice University, USA)</li><li>Vihan Lakshman (ThirdAI, USA)</li><li>Anshumali Shrivastava (Rice University &amp; ThirdAI, USA)</li></ul><h2 id="call-for-papers" tabindex="-1">Call for Papers <a class="header-anchor" href="#call-for-papers" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Call for Papers&quot;">​</a></h2><p>This workshop encourages submissions on original research, benchmarks, in-progress research results, and position papers.
